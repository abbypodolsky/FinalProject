		<h5> Help Us Reach Our Goal! </h5>

		<img src="assets/images/designdistrict.jpg" alt="Design District" width="500" height="370">
		<p> Abby's Bake Shop has been up and running in Coral Gables for only 5 years, and has many frequent customers that build the bakery community and make our day, everyday. We hope to open a shop in the Miami Design District by this summer! We are so close to our goal. It would help us so much if you could take a few minutes to learn about us, visit our shop, and sign to support us in this goal to show the Design District that this would be a good idea. Being a kickstart bakery made by a college student, any donations could help. Follow us on social media and join the cookie-crave family! We can't wait to meet all of you and share in the joy of Abby's Bake Shop. </p>
