     	<h2>Our Story</h2>
     	<img src="assets/images/baking.jpg" alt="Baking" width="300" height="333">
     	<p>Abby's Bake Shop opened in 2015 on a quiet street in Coral Gables with Abby, her mom and a couple of employees - not knowing what would come of the adventure. She wanted to create an awesome bakery for the neighborhood where neighbors would become friends and the bakery would be part of the local life. <br></br>

		Abby's Bake Shop is comprised of and for the community. We hire local college kids at the University of Miami all the time; our favorites are from Elliot Rodriguez's coding class. We have made cakes and cupcakes for student's birthdays, and helped people in the community to have a quiet, homey place to go to enjoy our delicious products.<br></br>

		Now Coral Gables is busier than ever and so are we. Our menu and staff have grown and we plan to open another shop in the Miami Design District. We can’t wait to hopefully be part of the Design District area and expand our bakery family with new staff, neighbors and friends!<br></br>

		It has been an amazing journey so far making these recipes from scratch and making others smiles. We’re thankful you’ve come along with us!</p>

		<h5> Help Us Reach Our Goal! </h5>

		<img src="assets/images/designdistrict.jpg" alt="Design District" width="500" height="370">
		<p> Abby's Bake Shop has been up and running in Coral Gables for only 5 years, and has many frequent customers that build the bakery community and make our day, everyday. We hope to open a shop in the Miami Design District by this summer! We are so close to our goal. It would help us so much if you could take a few minutes to learn about us, visit our shop, and sign to support us in this goal to show the Design District that this would be a good idea. Being a kickstart bakery made by a college student, any donations could help. Follow us on social media and join the cookie-crave family! We can't wait to meet all of you and share in the joy of Abby's Bake Shop. </p>
